# Bank-Loan-Report-Data-Analysis-Using-PowerBI-SQL

Project Name: Bank Loan Report Analysis This Project involves analyzing the dataset of Bank Loan Report by using SQL and Power BI. The main objective of the projects are :

Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) Requirements:


DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY

Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period.

2.Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds given to the applicants.

3.Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment.

4.Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans.

5.Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us to determine their financial  health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and 
track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.


Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s :

Good Loan:
1.Good Loan Application
2.Good Loan Applications  Percentage
3.Good Loan Funded Amount
4.Good Loan Total Received Amount

Bad Loan :
1.Bad Loan Application 
2.Bad Loan Applications Percentage
3.Bad Loan Funded Amount
4.Bad Loan Total Received Amount


Loan Status Grid View :

In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status’. By providing insights into metrics
such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount', 'Total Amount Received', 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount', 'MTD Amount Received', 'Average Interest Rate', and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)',
this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions .



DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW

CHARTS :
1.Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

2.Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity.

3.Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

4.Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):  The Lenders will check the borrowers occupation and income which helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.

5.Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):  The Lender will check what purpose the applicant taking loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.

6.Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications.

Metrics to be shown: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'



DASHBOARD 3: DETAILS

GRID :

Need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard will gives us loan-related metrics and data points, 
enabling users to access critical information efficiently.

Objective:
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights
into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
